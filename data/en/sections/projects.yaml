    summary:
      Cluster customers reviews on twitter corpus based on recurring patterns.
      We should be able to get a sense of the specific topic in each cluster, what the
      customers are complaining about based on specific patterns. The twitter corpus
      contains a lot of noise and we will try to minimize this and create sense out of the data.
